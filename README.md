# python-challenge
The python challenges found here are examples of data analysis work

In this challenge we were tasked to create 2 scripts 1 for a banking analysis and the other challenge is for updating a poll voting system.

The script PyBank creates a summary through python the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


The script PyPoll creates through python a tally of votes and breaks it down into the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote
